I will find the distance for you between 2 places.
Enter place 1? Delft
Enter place 2? Bratislava
Coordinates for Delft: N  51째 59' 58.0459", E   4째 21' 45.8083"
Coordinates for Bratislava: N  48째  9'  6.1157", E  17째  6' 33.5027"
The distance between Delft and Bratislava is 1003.4 km
Enter place 1? 
Enter place 2? quit
Bye bye.

Enter place 1? where is this place?
Enter place 2? 
I did not understand this place: where is this place?
